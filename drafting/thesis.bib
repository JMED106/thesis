abstract = {Recurrently coupled networks of inhibitory neurons robustly generate oscillations in the gamma band. Nonetheless, the corresponding Wilson-Cowan type firing rate equation for such an inhibitory population does not generate such oscillations without an explicit time delay. We show that this discrepancy is due to a voltage-dependent spike-synchronization mechanism inherent in networks of spiking neurons which is not captured by standard firing rate equations. Here we investigate an exact low-dimensional description for a network of heterogeneous canonical type-I inhibitory neurons which includes the sub-threshold dynamics crucial for generating synchronous states. In the limit of slow synaptic kinetics the spike-synchrony mechanism is suppressed and the standard Wilson-Cowan equations are formally recovered as long as external inputs are also slow. However, even in this limit synchronous spiking can be elicited by inputs which fluctuate on a time-scale of the membrane time-constant of the neurons. Our meanfield equations therefore represent an extension of the standard Wilson-Cowan equations in which spike synchrony is also correctly described.},

abstract = {In this manuscript we analyze the collective behavior of mean-field limits of large-scale, spatially extended stochastic neuronal networks with delays. Rigorously, the asymptotic regime of such systems is characterized by a very intricate stochastic delayed integro-differential McKean-Vlasov equation that remain impenetrable, leaving the stochastic collective dynamics of such networks poorly understood. In order to study these macroscopic dynamics, we analyze networks of firing-rate neurons, i.e. with linear intrinsic dynamics and sigmoidal interactions. In that case, we prove that the solution of the mean-field equation is Gaussian, hence characterized by its two first moments, and that these two quantities satisfy a set of coupled delayed integro-differential equations. These equations are similar to usual neural field equations, and incorporate noise levels as a parameter, allowing analysis of noise-induced transitions. We identify through bifurcation analysis several qualitative transitions due to noise in the mean-field limit. In particular, stabilization of spatially homogeneous solutions, synchronized oscillations, bumps, chaotic dynamics, wave or bump splitting are exhibited and arise from static or dynamic Turing-Hopf bifurcations. These surprising phenomena allow further exploring the role of noise in the nervous system. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We employ matrix-free Newton--Krylov solvers and perform numerical continuation of localized patterns directly on the integral form of the equation. This opens up the possibility of studying systems whose synaptic kernel does not lead to an equivalent PDE formulation. We present a numerical bifurcation study of localized states and show that the proposed models support patterns of activity with varying spatial extent through the mechanism of homoclinic snaking. The regular organization of these patterns is due to spatial interactions at a specific scale associated with the separation of excitation peaks in the chosen connectivity function.

@article{Coombes2003,
abstract = {We consider a firing rate model of a neuronal network continuum that incorporates axo-dendritic synaptic processing and the finite conduction velocities of action potentials. The model equation is an integral one defined on a spatially extended domain. Apart from a spatial integral mixing the network connectivity function with space-dependent delays, arising from non-instantaneous axonal communication, the integral model also includes a temporal integration over some appropriately identified distributed delay kernel. These distributed delay kernels are biologically motivated and represent the response of biological synapses to spiking inputs. They are interpreted as Green's functions of some linear differential operator. Exploiting this Green's function description we discuss formal reductions of this non-local system to equivalent partial differential equation (PDE) models. We distinguish between those spatial connectivity functions that give rise to local PDE models and those that give rise to PDE models with delayed non-local terms. For cases in which local PDEs are derived, we investigate traveling wave solutions in a comoving frame by numerically computing global heteroclinic connections for sigmoidal firing rate functions. We also calculate exact solutions, parameterized by axonal conduction velocity, for the Heaviside firing rate function (the sigmoidal firing rate function in the limit of infinite gain). The inclusion of synaptic adaptation is shown to alter traveling wave fronts to traveling pulses, which we study analytically and numerically in terms of a global homoclinic orbit. Finally, we consider the impact of dendritic interactions on waves and on static spatially localized solutions. Exact analysis for infinite gain shows that axonal delays do not affect the stability of single bumps. Furthermore, numerical continuation for finite gain leads to multiple bump solutions, and it is demonstrated that such localized multi-bumps are lost (in favor of global patterns) when a stable N-bump and an unstable (N + 2)-bump coalesce. In essence, the work in this paper illustrates how physiologically significant features of synaptic processing, synaptic adaptation and patterns of axo-dendritic connectivity may be analyzed within a neural field firing rate framework. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Both spontaneous and evoked potentials measured on the surface of the head are believed due to postsynaptic potentials in vertically oriented neurons in the cortex. Potential differences between surface locations at any given time are due to the instantaneous difference in synaptic activity between the corresponding vertical regions. Because of the high correlation of activity between regions separated by distances large compared to the radius of influence of single neurons, communication between these locations must be by means of action potentials. In order to quantify the dynamics of interaction of 1010 cortical neurons, use is made of the concept of a neural mass. The neural mass consists of sufficiently large number of neurons so as to exhibit certain average properties which are independent of its exact inner circuitry. An integral wave equation is derived to describe the spatial-temporal variation of cortical potential. Solutions are obtained indicating that electrical oscillations, which are independent of the location and time history of subcortical input, can persist in the cortex. The nature of these oscillations depends on the relative abundance of excitatory and inhibitory connections between neural masses and on the physiological state of the brain. The latter is partially determined by velocity distribution functions for action potential propagation. A dispersion relation for brain waves is shown to exist for certain ranges of the connection parameters. In some limiting cases, weakly damped waves occur with ??=ck, where c refers to a characteristic velocity for the distribution functions. Preliminary experiments indicate qualitative agreement with this result. ?? 1974.},

First, we focus on the use of linear stability theory to show how to destabilize a fixed point, leading to the onset of oscillatory behaviour. Next, we show for the choice of a Heaviside nonlinearity for the firing rate that such emergent oscillations can be either synchronous or anti-synchronous, depending on whether inhibition or excitation dominates the network architecture. To probe the behaviour of smooth (sigmoidal) nonlinear firing rates, we use a mixture of numerical bifurcation analysis and direct simulations, and uncover parameter windows that support chaotic behaviour.

They have proven especially useful in understanding brain rhythms. However, although motivated by neurobiological considerations they are phenomenological in nature, and cannot hope to recreate some of the rich repertoire of responses seen in real neuronal tissue. In this chapter we consider the {\$}\backslashtheta{\$}-neuron model that has recently been shown to admit to an exact mean-field description for instantaneous pulsatile interactions. We show that the inclusion of a more realistic synapse model leads to a mean-field model that has many of the features of a neural mass model coupled to a further dynamical equation that describes the evolution of network synchrony. A bifurcation analysis is used to uncover the primary mechanism for generating oscillations at the single and two population level. Numerical simulations also show that the phenomena of event related synchronisation and desynchronisation are easily realised. Importantly unlike its phenomenological counterpart this $\backslash$textit{\{}next generation neural mass model{\}} is an exact macroscopic description of an underlying microscopic spiking neurodynamics, and is a natural candidate for use in future large scale human brain simulations.},

We randomly add long-range and simultaneously remove short-range connections within the network to form a small-world network and investigate the effects of this rewiring on the existence and stability of the bump solution. We consider two limits in which continuum equations can be derived; bump solutions are fixed points of these equations. We can thus use standard numerical bifurcation analysis to determine the stability of these bumps and to follow them as parameters (such as rewiring probabilities) are varied. We find that under some rewiring schemes bumps are quite robust, whereas in other schemes they can become unstable via Hopf bifurcation or even be destroyed in saddle-node bifurcations.},

abstract = {It is shown, under weak conditions, that the dynamical evolution of large systems of globally coupled phase oscillators with Lorentzian distributed oscillation frequencies is, in an appropriate physical sense, time-asymptotically attracted toward a reduced manifold of the system states. This manifold was previously known and used to facilitate the discovery of attractors and bifurcations of such systems. The result of this paper establishes that attractors for the order parameter dynamics obtained by restriction to this reduced manifold are, in fact, the only such attractors of the full system. Thus all long time dynamical behaviors of the order parameters of these systems can be obtained by restriction to the reduced manifold.},

abstract = {Author SummaryNeuronal responses are often characterized by the rate at which action potentials are generated rather than by the timing of individual spikes. Firing-rate descriptions of neural activity are appealing because of their comparative simplicity, but it is important to develop models that faithfully approximate dynamic features arising from spiking. In particular, synchronization or partial synchronization of spikes is an important feature that cannot be described by typical firing-rate models. Here we develop a model that is nearly as simple as the simplest firing-rate models and yet can account for a number of aspects of spiking dynamics, including partial synchrony. The model matches the dynamic activity of networks of spiking neurons with surprising accuracy. By expanding the range of dynamic phenomena that can be described by simple firing-rate equations, this model should be useful in guiding intuition about and understanding of neural circuit function.},

Under robust and general assumptions compatible with the morestringent assumptions usually made about excitable systems, we show thatsuch a coupled system can display bursting, i.e. a stablesolution in which some variable undergoes rapid oscillations followed bya period of quiescence, with both oscillation and quiescence continuallyrepeated. Under a further weak condition, the bursting is "parabolic",i.e. the local frequency of the fast oscillation increases andthen decreases within a burst. The technique in this paperinvolves nonlinear changes of coordinates which transform the equations intoones which are closely related to Hill's equation. {\textcopyright}1986 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics},

abstract = {A major goal of neuroscience, statistical physics, and nonlinear dynamics is to understand how brain function arises from the collective dynamics of networks of spiking neurons. This challenge has been chiefly addressed through large-scale numerical simulations. Alternatively, researchers have formulated mean-field theories to gain insight into macroscopic states of large neuronal networks in terms of the collective firing activity of the neurons, or the firing rate. However, these theories have not succeeded in establishing an exact correspondence between the firing rate of the network and the underlying microscopic state of the spiking neurons. This has largely constrained the range of applicability of such macroscopic descriptions, particularly when trying to describe neuronal synchronization. Here, we provide the derivation of a set of exact macroscopic equations for a network of spiking neurons. Our results reveal that the spike generation mechanism of individual neurons introduces an effective coupling between two biophysically relevant macroscopic quantities, the firing rate and the mean membrane potential, which together govern the evolution of the neuronal network. The resulting equations exactly describe all possible macroscopic dynamical states of the network, including states of synchronous spiking activity. Finally, we show that the firing-rate description is related, via a conformal map, to a low-dimensional description in terms of the Kuramoto order parameter, called Ott-Antonsen theory. We anticipate that our results will be an important tool in investigating how large networks of spiking neurons self-organize in time to process and encode information in the brain.},

abstract = {When the local field potential of a cortical network displays coherent fast oscillations ( approximately 40-Hz gamma or approximately 200-Hz sharp-wave ripples), the spike trains of constituent neurons are typically irregular and sparse. The dichotomy between rhythmic local field and stochastic spike trains presents a challenge to the theory of brain rhythms in the framework of coupled oscillators. Previous studies have shown that when noise is large and recurrent inhibition is strong, a coherent network rhythm can be generated while single neurons fire intermittently at low rates compared to the frequency of the oscillation. However, these studies used too simplified synaptic kinetics to allow quantitative predictions of the population rhythmic frequency. Here we show how to derive quantitatively the coherent oscillation frequency for a randomly connected network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with realistic synaptic parameters. In a noise-dominated interneuronal network, the oscillation frequency depends much more on the shortest synaptic time constants (delay and rise time) than on the longer synaptic decay time, and approximately 200-Hz frequency can be realized with synaptic time constants taken from slice data. In a network composed of both interneurons and excitatory cells, the rhythmogenesis is a compromise between two scenarios: the fast purely interneuronal mechanism, and the slower feedback mechanism (relying on the excitatory-inhibitory loop). The properties of the rhythm are determined essentially by the ratio of time scales of excitatory and inhibitory currents and by the balance between the mean recurrent excitation and inhibition. Faster excitation than inhibition, or a higher excitation/inhibition ratio, favors the feedback loop and a much slower oscillation (typically in the gamma range).},

abstract = {The cortex is a complex system, characterized by its dynamics and architecture, which underlie many functions such as action, perception, learning, language, and cognition. Its structural architecture has been studied for more than a hundred years; however, its dynamics have been addressed much less thoroughly. In this paper, we review and integrate, in a unifying framework, a variety of computational approaches that have been used to characterize the dynamics of the cortex, as evidenced at different levels of measurement. Computational models at different space-time scales help us understand the fundamental mechanisms that underpin neural processes and relate these processes to neuroscience data. Modeling at the single neuron level is necessary because this is the level at which information is exchanged between the computing elements of the brain; the neurons. Mesoscopic models tell us how neural elements interact to yield emergent behavior at the level of microcolumns and cortical columns. Macroscopic models can inform us about whole brain dynamics and interactions between large-scale neural systems such as cortical regions, the thalamus, and brain stem. Each level of description relates uniquely to neuroscience data, from single-unit recordings, through local field potentials to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). Models of the cortex can establish which types of large-scale neuronal networks can perform computations and characterize their emergent properties. Mean-field and related formulations of dynamics also play an essential and complementary role as forward models that can be inverted given empirical data. This makes dynamic models critical in integrating theory and experiments. We argue that elaborating principled and informed models is a prerequisite for grounding empirical neuroscience in a cogent theoretical framework, commensurate with the achievements in the physical sciences.},

abstract = {Neural field models of firing rate activity have had a major impact in helping to develop an understanding of the dynamics seen in brain slice preparations. These models typically take the form of integro-differential equations. Their non-local nature has led to the development of a set of analytical and numerical tools for the study of waves, bumps and patterns, based around natural extensions of those used for local differential equation models. In this paper we present a review of such techniques and show how recent advances have opened the way for future studies of neural fields in both one and two dimensions that can incorporate realistic forms of axo-dendritic interactions and the slow intrinsic currents that underlie bursting behaviour in single neurons.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the emotional effect of dynamic presen- tation of facial expressions. Dynamic and static facial expressions of negative and positive emotions were presented using computer-morphing (Experiment 1) and videos of natural changes (Experiment 2), as well as other dynamic and static mosaic images. Participants rated the valence and arousal of their emotional response to the stimuli. The participants consistently reported higher arousal responses to dynamic than to static presentation of facial expressions and mosaic images for both valences. Dynamic presentation had no effect on the valence ratings. These results suggest that dynamic presentation of emotional facial expressions enhances the overall emotional experience without a corresponding qualitative change in the experience, although this effect is not specific to facial images.},

Random nets consisting of many different classes of elements are also analyzed. Special attention is paid to nets of randomly connected excitatory and inhibitory elements. It is shown that a stable oscillation exists in such a net¿in contrast with the fact that no stable oscillations exist in a net of statistically symmetric structure even if negative as well as positive synaptic weights are permitted at a time.

abstract = {The pattern of nerve action potentials produced by unit permeability changes (quantal inputs) occurring at random is considered analytically and by computer simulation methods. The important parameters of a quantal input are size and duration. Varying both the mean and the probability density function of these parameters has calculable effects on the distribution of interspike intervals. Particular attention is paid to the relation between the mean rate of excitatory inputs and the mean frequency of nerve action potentials (input-output curve) and the relation between the coefficient of variation for the interval distribution and the mean interval (variability curve). In the absence of action potentials one can determine the parameters of the voltage distribution including the autocorrelation function and the power spectrum. These parameters can sometimes be used to approximate the variability of interspike intervals as a function of the threshold voltage. Different neuronal models are considered including one containing the Hodgkin-Huxley membrane equations. The negative feedback inherent in the Hodgkin-Huxley equations tends to produce a small negative serial correlation between successive intervals. The results are discussed in relation to the interpretation of experimental results. {\textcopyright} 1967, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Approximate equations are derived for the amount of information a nerve cell or group of nerve cells can transmit about a stimulus of a given duration using a frequency code (i.e., assuming the mean frequency of nerve impulses measures the intensity of a maintained stimulus). The equations take into account the variability of successive interspike intervals, and any serial correlations between successive intervals, but do not require detailed assumptions about the mechanism of impulse initiation. The errors involved in using these approximations are evaluated for neurons which discharge either completely regularly, completely at random (Poisson process) or show a particular type of intermediate variability (gamma distribution model). The errors become negligibly small as the stimulus duration or the number of functionally similar nerve cells increases. The conditions for applying these equations to experimental data are discussed. The application of these equations should help considerably in eliminating the enormous discrepancies between some earlier estimates for the information processing capabilities of single nerve cells and systems of nerve cells. {\textcopyright} 1967, The Biophysical Society.

The distribution of time intervals between successive neuronal firings (interresponse time histogram), the firing rate as a function of input frequency, the variability in the time course of depolarization from trial to trial, and the strength-duration curve are derived for this model. The predictions are compared with data from the literature and good qualitative agreement is found. All parameters are experimentally measurable and a direct test of the theory is possible with present techniques. The assumptions of the model are relaxed and the effects of such experimentally found phenomena as relative refractory and supernormal periods, adaptation, potentiation, and rhythmic slow potentials are discussed.

In the present paper it is shown that this is not so and that either a relatively large-scale structure of the aggregate or the presence of inhibitory connections makes a stable intermediate activity possible. It is suggested that large-scale structure can usefully be discussed from an information-theoretic viewpoint and that it is also related to the ergodic problem of classical mechanics.},

@article{Hubel1968,
abstract = {1. The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or patterns of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously described in the cat. On the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion of the cells are colour coded.2. Evidence is presented for at least two independent systems of columns extending vertically from surface to white matter. Columns of the first type contain cells with common receptive-field orientations. They are similar to the orientation columns described in the cat, but are probably smaller in cross-sectional area. In the second system cells are aggregated into columns according to eye preference. The ocular dominance columns are larger than the orientation columns, and the two sets of boundaries seem to be independent.3. There is a tendency for cells to be grouped according to symmetry of responses to movement; in some regions the cells respond equally well to the two opposite directions of movement of a line, but other regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction and cells favouring the other.4. A horizontal organization corresponding to the cortical layering can also be discerned. The upper layers (II and the upper two-thirds of III) contain complex and hypercomplex cells, but simple cells are virtually absent. The cells are mostly binocularly driven. Simple cells are found deep in layer III, and in IV A and IV B. In layer IV B they form a large proportion of the population, whereas complex cells are rare. In layers IV A and IV B one finds units lacking orientation specificity; it is not clear whether these are cell bodies or axons of geniculate cells. In layer IV most cells are driven by one eye only; this layer consists of a mosaic with cells of some regions responding to one eye only, those of other regions responding to the other eye. Layers V and VI contain mostly complex and hypercomplex cells, binocularly driven.5. The cortex is seen as a system organized vertically and horizontally in entirely different ways. In the vertical system (in which cells lying along a vertical line in the cortex have common features) stimulus dimensions such as retinal position, line orientation, ocular dominance, and perhaps directionality of movement, are mapped in sets of superimposed but independent mosaics. The horizontal system segregates cells in layers by hierarchical orders, the lowest orders (simple cells monocularly driven) located in and near layer IV, the higher orders in the upper and lower layers.},

@article{Mountcastle1957,
abstract = {THE PRESENT PAPER describes some observations upon the modality and topographical attributes of single neurons of the first somatic sensory area of the cat's cerebral cortex, the analogue of the cortex of the postcentral gyrus in the primate brain. These data, together with others upon the response latencies of the cells of different layers of the cortex to peripheral stimuli, support an hypothesis of the functional organization of this cortical area. This is that the neurons which lie in narrow vertical columns, or cylinders, extending from layer II through layer VI make up an elementary unit of organization, for they are activated by stimulation of the same single class of peripheral receptors, from almost identical peripheral receptive fields, at latencies which are not significantly different for the cells of the various layers. It is emphasized that this pattern of organization obtains only for the early repetitive responses of cortical neurons to brief peripheral stimuli. These neurons may be related in quite different organization patterns when analyzed in terms of later discharges. A report of these experiments was made to the American Physiological Society in September, 1955 (10, 17).},
